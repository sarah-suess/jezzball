To start: press the start key.

This should start moving the green outer box and the atom inside the box.

Use the up, down, left, and right keys to draw lines extending from the green outer box.
You want to get the atom inside the new box without touching the lines as they draw or else you lose a life.
If you lose a life, the game will reset with one less life and you can press start to resume.
If you lose all three lives, you lose.
If you make the box smaller than 625 pixels, you win!

If you win or lose, press the start button to reset the game. Then press start again to being playing again!
